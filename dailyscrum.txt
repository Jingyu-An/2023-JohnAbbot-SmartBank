1. Team leader. Create project Git repository, shared by all team members and senditaway@hotmail.com.
Keep the repository PRIVATE.
You MUST add the proper content of .gitignore file *before* creating a project in it:
For VisualStudio: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/VisualStudio.gitignore

DO NOT USE BRANCHES functionality in Git.

2. Watch "Scrum in 10 minutes" video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM
